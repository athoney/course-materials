Lab 2 - Port Scanner
bhg-scanner/main
purpose: Main runs the scanner package which takes in two values from the terminal. One,
    a port to start scanning at, and two, a port to stop scanning at. The PortScanner() method returns the number
    of ports it scanned and prints all of the open and closed ports to the screen.
todo modifications: In the TODOS, I added a DialTimeout function to stop waiting for a response on a port after 2
    seconds. Also, I added functionality to handle and appropriately process a list of the closed ports. Finally, 
    I modified the function to return two ints, the length of the closed and open ports arrays.
my modification: I modified scanner.go to use input values from main as a range of ports to scan. If the user does
    not supply values, or supplies negative values, the default range is 1-1024. NOTE: since the terminal is used
    to prompt the user for port values, if the user tries to send the output to a csv file, the terminal prompts
    will also appear in the csv file.
