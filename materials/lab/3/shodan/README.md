# Lab 3b - Shodan API
## Modifications:
I chose options 1 and 2:
1. I created myip.go which uses the utility method /tools/myip to return your *not so exciting* IP address as seen by the internet. This is a simple modification, but I enjoyed the practice.
2. I modified host.go to include a page number variable in the query
